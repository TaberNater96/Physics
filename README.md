From my first encounter with programming in a computational physics course, the power of code to unravel the mysteries of the universe immediately captivated me. Python, with its elegance and versatility, became my tool of choice, enabling me to dive deep into data analysis and calculations that push the boundaries of what we understand about physics. This particular repository is a testament to this journey, showcasing projects where theory meets practice, from calculating complex calculus equations to producing insightful and visually unique images. All of the computational physics projects and assignments here were conducted in a single 10-week term, where I had never been exposed to programming before. These projects will prove how fast of a learner I am, and how I can navigate the challenges of any problem, no matter how complicated or unfamiliar the topics are.

## Project Summaries

#### Solar System Animation
For my term project for computational physics, I created a realistic solar system animation that models the orbits of the solar system.
