My first encounter with programming stemmed from a course I took during my Physics degree called "Computational Physics" where we needed to calculate and visualize complex physics problems using Python. This programming language became my tool of choice for the years to come, enabling me to dive deep into data analysis and calculations that push the boundaries of what we understand about physics, skills that have become invaluable throughout my entire academic career. This particular repository is a testament to this journey, showcasing projects where theory meets practice, from calculating complex calculus equations to producing insightful and visually unique images. These projects represent just the beginning of my academic achievements and the depth of knowledge I've gained in both my Physics and Data Science studies. 

Throughout a single 10-week term, I immersed myself in computational physics projects and assignments without any prior exposure to programming. This experience is a testament to my quick learning abilities and my capacity to tackle complex and unfamiliar challenges head-on. These projects marked the beginning of my journey to where I stand today, igniting my passion for data, science, and programming.

  <h2>Solar System Animation</h2>
</div>

For my term project in computational physics, I developed an animation that accurately depicts the solar system using, modeling the orbits of each planet. The code for this animation is built using VPython, otherwise known as GlowScript. This animation is a true-to-life representation, where the scale of the planets is proportional to the Sun, and each planet follows its real-life orbital path, velocity, rotation, and angle. The animation here is sped up to 10,000 times faster than in real life, but can be adjusted down to 1 if desired.

Although the dropdown button for planet selection is not visible during recordings, the actual program allows users to select any planet and observe its orbit around the Sun. Going beyond the basics, I integrated an animated graph that updates in real-time to track and plot the distances of the planets throughout the animation, showcasing the vast scale of our solar system.
