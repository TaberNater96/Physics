From my first encounter with programming in a computational physics course, the power of code to unravel the mysteries of the universe immediately captivated me. Python, with its elegance and versatility, became my tool of choice, enabling me to dive deep into data analysis and calculations that push the boundaries of what we understand about physics. This particular repository is a testament to this journey, showcasing projects where theory meets practice, from calculating complex calculus equations to producing insightful and visually unique images. These projects represent just the beginning of my academic achievements and the depth of knowledge I've gained in both my Physics and Data Science studies.

Throughout a single 10-week term, I immersed myself in computational physics projects and assignments without any prior exposure to programming. This experience is a testament to my quick learning abilities and my capacity to tackle complex and unfamiliar challenges head-on. These projects marked the beginning of my journey to where I stand today, igniting my passion for data, science, and programming.

## Project Summaries

#### Solar System Animation
For my term project in computational physics, I developed an animation that accurately depicts the solar system using, modeling the orbits of each planet. The code for this animation is built using VPython, otherwise known as GlowScript. This animation is a true-to-life representation, where the scale of the planets is proportional to the Sun, and each planet follows its real-life orbital path, velocity, rotation, and angle.

Although the dropdown button for planet selection is not visible during recordings, the actual program allows users to select any planet and observe its orbit around the Sun. Going beyond the basics, I integrated an animated graph that updates in real-time to track and plot the distances of the planets throughout the animation, showcasing the vast scale of our solar system.
